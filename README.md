*Connecting people on a whim*

Go on a whim to connect with the people around you.
You never know **w**ho **m**ight **s**ay **y**es!

## Overview
Meeting new people these days is often attempted through dating or networking apps, but the opportunity to make new connections shouldn't be limited to only single people or those who attend large networking events. 

**wmsy** encourages users to be spontaneous in their spare time by inviting others to join them for activities, called "Whims", ranging from a quick coffee break to a last minute bar trivia team. It's fun to go on a Whim and connect with the people around you!

## Features
- Users can log in to wmsy using an existing Facebook account.
- Users can customize their wmsy profile bio. Their display name and profile picture are derive from their Facebook account.
- Hosting a Whim posts it to the public feed and map for others to Show Interest in.
- A Whim Host can choose the location that a Whim is displayed on the public map. This can be an exact location or a point in the general meeting area, at the discretion of the Host.
- Users can only see Whims located within a 1 mile radius of their current location.
- Whims expire in 24 hours or less, depending on the Host's preference, and disappear from the app when they expire.
- Whims can be sorted by category to make it easier to find activities of interest.
- The Host of a Whim has access to a private chat room where they can view the profiles of Interested users and Invite them into their chatroom to discuss further details.
- Hosts can invite as many Interested guests into their Whim chatroom as they would like, as well as remove any guests they do not want to meet.
